### TODO.md

Working:

* Start, logging
* Detect BR24, 3G, 4G and HALO radars
* Detect Raymarine radars (tested with Quantum 2)
* Detect Furuno radars (tested with DRS4D-NXT)
* Provide webserver for static and dynamic pages
* Serve Navico and Furuno radar data
* Control Navico radar (tested with 4G and HALO)
* Trails in relative mode
* Getting heading and location from Signal K or NMEA 0183 server

Work in Progress:

* Target acquisition (M)ARPA
* Detect Garmin xHD (but not yet know if different from HD)
* Furuno control - implemented for DRS4D-NXT (except ARPA)

TODO:

* Everything else


### dirkwa

files the same? WASM/Standalone?
- locator rs
- Build rs
- command rs?

Does the model database have the functions?
PARTIALLY - The ModelInfo struct in mayara-core has:
✅ Range tables, spokes, characteristics
✅ Feature flags (has_doppler, has_dual_range)
✅ Control IDs list (controls: &'static [&'static str])
❌ NO actual control command implementations - those are in mayara-lib only
3. Same registration to SignalK?
NO - They are different:
mayara-lib + mayara-server: Uses its own REST API (/v1/api/radars), not SignalK
mayara-signalk-wasm: Registers via sk_register_radar_provider FFI, uses SignalK's radar API
They don't share registration code - they're two different architectures.

- raymarin, halo, etc just stubs by now in core. 
- rest api same as SignalK? for standalone?


- build warnings?
- Add WebGPU view for standalone
- Update all docs
- Update Readme
-- Link Wasm readme
